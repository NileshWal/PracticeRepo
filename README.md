# PracticeApps

The goal is to make use of as many Android architectural components and latest best practices to
make app development easy and modular.

The Android architectural components and libraries used:
1. Kotlin.
2. Partial MVVM. Repository module is yet to be implemented.
3. Coroutines.
4. Jetpack Compose.
5. Navigation Component (Had implemented earlier but reverted to traditional Navigation Drawer to
   check feasibility with Jetpack Compose).
6. Retrofit2 (Networking). May go for KTor after doing RnD on it.
7. Lifecycle-aware.
8. Room Database.
9. HILT implementation in progress.
